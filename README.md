<h3>What is the goal of arbitrage trading?</h3>

The goal of arbitrage trading is to find the difference in the price of a token on different exchanges. Sometimes the difference in the price of the same token can be more than 20%.
With sufficient starting capital, the arbitrage trader tries to quickly buy a token at a low price on one exchange and immediately sell it at a higher price on another. This is the simplest arbitrage scheme.
The difficulties of arbitrage on Centralized Exchanges (CEX) are high trade commissions, high withdrawal fee and long waiting time, which greatly increases the risk of losses.

These difficulties are not observed on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) and DEFI 

<h3>We've changed the rules of the game!</h3>
With the development of decentralized exchanges and automated arbitrage trading system everyone can start arbitrage trading.
Automated Arbitrage trading is a stable high profit and saved nerves and time.
